# T5 Beams Exploration for Reasoning

T5 Beams Exploration for Reasoning is the idea to make a [T5 model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.10683.pdf) generate many alternative answers to a problem and then choose the best one externally leveraging domain knowledge, linguistic knowledge or just some common sense. The code available in this repository refers to a prototype successfully applied to the [ProofWriter](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.13048.pdf) architecture.

I proposed this technique as part of my Computer Engineering master's degree thesis.
